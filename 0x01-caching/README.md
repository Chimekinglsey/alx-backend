Caching is a computer designed targeted at reducing the latency of fetch operations for the processor. This is achieved by storing frequently accessed data in  a small memory close to the processor.
While new data is requested, various means of discarding data stored already (known as caching algorithm) is required. They inlude FIFO, LIFO, LRU, LFU, MRU, SLRU and so many more.
In this project we will be coding our own caching algorithm using Python
